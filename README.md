# Very Simple Node + ExpressJS + HTML5 Boilerplate starter app 

I've seen a number of similar projects - but they were all more complicated and in various stages of disrepair.
This is simply an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) starter app preconfigured to utilize properties of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as customized [Initializer](http://www.initializr.com/) 

See sample app running on Heroku at: [http://severe-sword-2201.heroku.com/](http://severe-sword-2201.heroku.com/)
