# Very Simple ExpressJS Boilerplate App 

Built w/ HTML5 Boilerplate

I've seen a numer of simmilar projects - but they were all more complicated and in various stages of disrepair.
This is simply a ExpressJS http://expressjs.com/ app preconfigured to utilize the main properties of HTML5 Boilerplate http://html5boilerplate.com/ via Initializer http://www.initializr.com/
