# Very Simple ExpressJS Boilerplate App 

Built w/ HTML5 Boilerplate

I've seen a number of similar projects - but they were all more complicated and in various stages of disrepair.
This is simply an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) starter app preconfigured to utilize properties of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) created via [Initializer](http://www.initializr.com/)
